# constructionsafetyontology
The construction safety ontology is designed to formalize the expertise and knowledge that goes into accident data descriptions, to ensure not only the consistent structure in data representations, but the quality and richness in descriptions as well. Using this ontology, accident cases can be modelled as named individuals (instances), with four asserted data properties namely title, description, date and source. The data type for the title and description properties are strings, specified through the XSD schema; while the date property is specified with an XSD schema datetime value. The source data property is assigned an anyURI value. In terms of class definitions, 10 classes can be designated namely accident type, accident cause, building type, injury type, degree of injury, project type, project cost, workspace, work type and equipment.
